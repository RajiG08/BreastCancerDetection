Breast cancer detection using thermographic images with VGG-16 algorithm
Breast cancer is a type of tumor that develops in the breast tissues. It is the most
common type of cancer found in women worldwide, and it is one of the leading causes of
death in women. This paper provides an idea about machine learning techniques that are
being used for breast cancer prediction.
Breast cancer is one of the major reasons for the increase in female mortality
rate.There are several technologies introduced to reduce the mortality rate but the early
detection of this disease has contributed to the reduction of the mortality rate.
Thermal imaging has been employed to detect early breast cancer and predict risk. By
observing temperature distribution in both breasts, thermography, a non-invasive and
non-contact cancer screening method, can detect tumors at an early stage, even in
precancerous conditions.
Thermography is a viable technology for earlier detection in which thermal cameras
with high sensitivity as well as resolution are used. In this work VGG 16 and CNN with
transfer learning have been used to process the thermal images. This technique is then
applied to various breast thermograms generated by various thermography centers. The
model is then trained using several thermographic images. By using these algorithms the
accuracy of this model is 93%.
